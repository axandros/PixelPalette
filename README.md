# PixelPalette
Program to convert a list of Hex Values into a small square palette, intended for use in flat 3d texturing.

## The problem
[Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list) has a wonderful collection of low color palettes, and modern low-poly 3D models can use these palettes to [amazing affect](https://www.syntystudios.com/).  However, Lospec's image downloads have them in a straight line when 3D model textures need a square image.  This program is going to take the hex value list from Lospec and produce an image file for this use.

## Supported formats
Currently none, but the current build is working towards bmp support.  I hope to add png and jpeg formats in the future.
